# Car Listing

CarListing app allows user to see list of cars on map as well as in the list.

### Features
1. See List of cars on map in the home screen.

2. User can then tap on the listing floating button to see the car list view.

3. User can select the car pin to see the selected car details.

### iOS Support

Minimum iOS version supported is 13.0

### Architectural Pattern

VIPER & MVVM

### Third party libraries

Used [SDWebImage](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage) for image handling.
- I chose this because its a great image downloader in async mode and also provide caching.

### Areas of improvement / Additions

1. Can add clustering for the car markers. So that would be a great addition when the list will have more items.
2. Support for dark mode will be a great addition.
